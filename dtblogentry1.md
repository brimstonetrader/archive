Hello! I am graduated, technically, from Hendrix College with a Bachelor's in Mathematics. I am still 
hanging out, though, because students who attended during the Covid online semesters get a year of school
with free tuition on graduating. It is marketed as a method to ensure that my generation will still have 
access to nostalgia. I think this is silly. If I could eliminate this emotion from my brain I would, 
because I find it to be detrimental in most situations. I am utilizing this opportunity so that I can 
build skills in Computer Science, and have some fun applying mathematics. This semester I am taking
Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, continuing my research detailed <a href="https://brimstonetrader.github.io/blog/Hiding_Information_From_The_AIs.pdf">here</a>, and participating in Disco Tray Studios.

I will be working to expand and refine video game prototypes that have sprung from Dr. Goadrich's Game
Development course over the past few years. Our first game is "Ground Truth", an educational game which
stars a St. Louis journalist in the year 1812. Our hero is writing an article on the broad sentiments in
rural Missouri, interviewing people and attempting to report truth. Halfway through, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1811â€“1812_New_Madrid_earthquakes">New Madrid Earthquakes</a> hit, and the 
protagonist must determine what really happened. I have already done some debugging and animation for 
the project, but our largest-scope goal is presently to create a transparent, working score system, as the 
current one does not function well. This will require creative writing, clever coding, and rigorous 
historical accuracy. I'm excited for this project for many reasons, primary among them that I have written 
many articles for our campus newsletter, and I have respect for the spirit of journalism. I hope that we 
can appropriately gamify the fact-checking process, and boost the historical value of this prototype.
