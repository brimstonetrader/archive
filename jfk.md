## Educated Guesses From The Hendrix Faculty 2

This month on Educated Guesses from the Hendrix Faculty, we will be speaking with Dr. Skok
and Dr. Hancock, getting their conjectures regarding the greatest unknown in American political
history, the assassination of our nation’s most reverberant golden ponyboy.

- BACKGROUND:

November 22, 1963. Dallas, Texas. A president is shot to death by a sketchy 24-year-old doofus
who just got back from the U.S.S.R., where he lived, married a local, and spoke fluent Russian.
This dude, Lee Harvey Oswald, had many odd ties to the CIA, what with his close friend George
De Mohrenschildt (a confirmed CIA asset), and military service at Atsugi in 1957 (A U.S. Air
Force Base in Japan that hosted CIA psychedelic mind-control experiments in line with
MK-ULTRA). He also had weird ties to the mafia, Castro, and so on. Lee was murdered two
days after the crime, on live TV, having adamantly sworn innocence at every chance, by a
seedy strip club guy named Jack Ruby, who himself died a few years later after successfully
keeping his mouth shut, so we never really got to hear Lee's, or, anyone’s side of the story. Did
he act alone? History Professors Jonathon Hancock and Deborah Skok say…

- HANCOCK:

I should preface with the fact that I specialize in early American history, and have not immersed
myself in the granular specifics of this incident in particular. Nevertheless, I think that events of
great importance like this, which capture the public imagination in this cross-generational way,
have dynamic narratives which morph along with our understanding of the present. The
assassination has been and will be reassessed and reinterpreted, but historians tend to be
skeptical towards conspiratorial thought without explicit evidence. Oswald was certainly sketchy,
and I'd grant that a lot of questions surrounding his background and the Zapruder film don't have
easy answers. Nevertheless, I find the continued interest in the question itself, as a sociological
phenomenon, to be the more interesting aspect of the situation.

- SKOK:

The Kennedy assassination is the massive, alluring black hole at the center of Modern
American History. There are thousands of books at this point that have been written on
the topic, hundreds of movies, and more online content than anyone could quantify. This glut of
information is a double-edged sword, as much of it is based on very tenuous evidence. The
Warren Commission, which LBJ established to investigate the assassination, was itself pretty
shoddy, and left many ambiguities in its verdict that Oswald acted alone. This lends legitimacy to
many flimsy narratives, as they seem "on par" with the truth. I'm fairly confident that most of the
ephemeral trivia that hovers around this event is hearsay, and that a "definitive" answer will
never surface. It's worth putting this event into the broader context, however, of the CIA and
FBI's shady domestic activities throughout the 20th century. I would believe almost anything
about the CIA, just based on their documented history, especially in this particular time period.
Truthfully, I grant that many individuals and groups had something to gain from the death of
JFK. I don't know who all was involved, but a couple of important things to keep in mind here
are Occam's Razor, and the fact that it's much harder to keep a conspiracy under wraps for 50
years, than to actually do one.
