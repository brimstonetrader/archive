- First off, tell me about your forthcoming Watson project. What's going on?

I painted a mural a couple years ago called "Ain't I A Woman." It was intended to educate uplift
black women worldwide who had been adversely affected by institutional racism in criminal,
medical, and various other contexts. After making the mural, it was completely vandalized twice.
We had to scrub and peel the paint off, the first time. Then, the second time, they used a latex
paint, so we were fortunately again able to peel it off. Now it's completely restored, and hasn't
been touched since.

I really can't wrap my head around why someone would do that. I don't know who could possibly
have the free time, energy, and balls to deface a mural. It was probably the timing, where the
nation was at that time. It was the Summer of Reckoning (2020), so there was a lot of protests
going on not far from where the mural was. It's funny, because I didn't have the chance to go to
any of the protests, because of COVID, and all that came with it. The mural was kind of like my
form of protest. Seeing the impact of my words on a community and how, in spite of the vitriol,
the mural remains up, has been really great to see. It's a form of preservation, and it kind of
captured that moment in history.

My Watson project was inspired by this. It deals with murals depicting or resulting from political
events and social movements, and seeing how they impact and serve as a source of cultural
preservation in the communities they depict. I'll be visiting England to look at some of Banksy's
stuff, and then Belfast. After that I'll be going to Italy, where there are a lot of cool, contemporary
murals, and then I'll be visiting Mexico, which has a very rich history of public art. All of the art
on my trip will be public. There are a few in Mexico that are commissioned by the government,
the government, because that's not uncommon in Mexican muralism, but they're still centered
around unity and empowerment.

- How has Hendrix, through undergrad and AGS, helped you to hone your artistic skills, identity, 
  and vision?

AGS [Arkansas Governor's School, a state-funded program for Arkansas high-school juniors
that, up until 2018, was held every summer at Hendrix] definitely gave me the technical skills to
paint, and generally helped me to begin turning ideas into something physical. Hendrix's Art
Department has really helped me to combine both of my passions together. It's shown me that
I'm not just a painter, but someone with a voice. Hendrix has engaged me within its community,
with my involvement with the NAACP, Art Club, and Revolutionary Reads. It's helped me find
like the intersection point of activism and art, which I hope to explore further with my Watson
Fellowship.

- How does public art persist as a beacon in the face of renegade adversity?

I've seen much more murals popping up around Conway and Little Rock over the past few
years. The crucial, and to me, defining thing about muralism is that once you create it, it's kind
of out of your hands, and it becomes property of the city or community it depicts. It's up to that
community to take care of it, and to maintain an interpretive, storytelling aspect. Because of
that, you have to take what you paint very seriously in murals, moreso than usual, and use the
space for good. So, if go to Seventh Street, and you see all the murals, they all have different
points of view, but the essential message is very clear. It's all in the interest of peace and justice,
and making sure that the world is becoming a better place.

- How has your business minor informed your artistic career? Or how do you intend for it to?

Honestly, my mom really thought it was a good idea. It helps with ensuring I'm not too far in the
red - supplies cost a lot of money. It also came in handy with the Watson, when I had to make a
budget for the entire year. Also, it's good to be a well rounded person, keeping my math skills up
to date. I know how to count still. It can be intense to get wrapped up in a creative project, it's
helpful to have a little break and do something that's - well, not practical, but just concrete.

- What is your favorite color?

So, my favorite color is orange. Any type of orange really, pastel, blood, Hendrix, neon, I like all
types of orange. It comes up a lot in my work, because of that, and also because orange is one
of the base colors for painting Black people. The compliment to orange is blue, so naturally, I
use a lot of blue too. Aside from that, I'm a figurative painter. I love to paint people in different
positions and use their positions to tell a story.

- Tell me about your purely aesthetic inspirations. Do you take more inspiration from the world
  around you, or from art?

Most of the time, my inspiration is internal, I pull from memories. I try to draw memories first, and
then try to replicate it through a photo, and then try and pick the photo. That process is
something I've definitely explored this year. I also take a lot of inspiration from Kehinde Wiley.
So, if that's your purely aesthetic inspirations, then what about your philosophical or cultural
inspirations?

I've explored the cultural aspect of art a lot more this year, with my Senior Capstone. The body
of work that I did for that was about how water has affected Black people, in a broad sense.
Most of it is pretty light on personal memory. A lot of the paintings that I've been have done
before have been very on the nose, like, you know exactly what it's about. But with memories, I
didn't realize going in how much history plays into what we do today, especially with water. As
far as philosophical inspiration, to be honest, I don't think very hard about like my art until it's
done. Usually, I realized what I did after the fact, and get a headache. This is especially true
when it comes to naming pieces.

- What is your favorite painting that you've ever done?

I'm gonna say that [Ain't No Sunshine](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYpYWK3J3Cd/?utm_source=ig) is my favorite right now. It's
orange and blue, an identity piece, both for who I am and what type of artist I wanted to be at
the time, whether those two meshed well together. That's definitely my favorite: every time I
think about it, I feel a different way.

- What's next for you?

There's the art majors' senior show. It's gonna be April 14. All five of us seniors will present on
our art from this year. It will be held at the Windgate, where I work. For the Watson I will
definitely be starting a blog, to document the year. All that will be on my website:
https://adaja-cooper-studio.myshopify.com/. You can look at some of my paintings there.
